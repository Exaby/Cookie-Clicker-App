# info
This repo uses [NWJS](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) and  [Cookie-Clicker-Sorce-Code](https://github.com/Trixter9994/Cookie-Clicker-Source-Code).
This was made for education purposes only, and takes code from orteil's amazing [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) game


# Changes to make this work
Created a package.json... That's it!


# Building the app
Runing the app is easy. All you need is the current version of this repo and the latest release of [NWJS](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) for your OS. Then it should be as simple as dragging the main folder in this repo (cookieclicker) onto nw.exe*

Building the application is also pretty simple, all you need is to get nw-builder via npm, and use `nw-builder .\projectroot\cookieclicker\` and within the same directory it will give you a `\build\` directory.
